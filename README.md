vmrc
====

vmrc is a Virtual Machine rc(8) script for managing bhyve, jail and QEMU virtual machines. 

Home page: http://vmrc.bsd.lv

Development snapshot: http://vmrc.bsd.lv/vmrc-snapshot.tar (Occasionally newer)

See the "known-issues.txt" file for up-to-date status information and there are developer notes at the end of "vmrc-instructions.txt".

As this is a work in progress, please consider submitting questions and feature requests prior to patches.

If you do submit pull requests, note that GitHub will combine requests until they are accepted as a group. This inadvertently makes them inseparable and thus unacceptable, arguably defeating the entire purpose of Git. One workaround is to submit each request from a different local branch.

Thank you for helping test bhyve and vmrc!
